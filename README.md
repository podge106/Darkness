# Darkness
Text Based Cave RPG.

I am someone who codes in their free time this is a fun little project for me to have fun making, and for other people to hopefully
have fun playing.

The pre-releases only have the .cs files as they're not really worth playing, I just put them for anyone who wants to look at my code. However when the game gets to a point where it can really be called a game I will start providing compiled .exe files as well as the C# code.
